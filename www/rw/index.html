          I am most acquanted with Javascript, HTML, CSS, Angular.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.

          I know PHP, CakePHP, and Wordpress reasonably well.

          I can get by in Python and C/C++ if necessary (or even assembly).

          I am currently an instructor at <a href="http://codingcamp.us/">Coding Campus</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)">MEAN stack</a> course (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js).
        As an instructor, I have had the opportunity to delve into the Javascript language and many of the technologies associated with it.
        The thing I appreciate most about teaching is that it requires you to have a much more complete understanding of the concepts than the average developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to Coding Campus, I was a Web Developer at <a href="http://www.unicity.com/usa/">Unicity</a>, where I was introduced to many of the topics that I now teach.

          Learning is now one of the most exciting parts of my life.
          Becoming a good programmer does not happen quickly or by accident.
          Peter Norvig puts this very well in his essay, <i><a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a></i>.
          Every day I exert deliberate effort to learn and improve, and I plan to continue this striving for decades to come.

          Working on projects is my favorite way to program. Much of my code can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/increscent">https://github.com/increscent</a>

          <a href="http://stacked.us">Stacked.us</a> is a way for anyone to leave and share ephemeral notes (they only last for 24 hours).

          I'm now learning <a href="https://github.com/increscent/haskell-exercises">Haskell</a> on my free time.
