        <h2>Breaks (11 Dec 2020)</h2>

        <p>
            I always forget the importance of taking breaks, so I'm writing this to remind myself. Breaks are helpful for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>They help you build back energy when you're tired</li>
            <li>They help you reflect about your work and make smart decisions</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The second reason may be even more helpful than the first. A thoughtful break can save you from spending time on things that you don't want/need to do. Often, the best thing to do is be lazy and think about what you can not do, instead of rushing to do everything.
        </p>
