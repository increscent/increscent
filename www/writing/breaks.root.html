    <h2>Breaks (11 Dec 2020)</h2>

    <p>
        I always forget the importance of taking breaks, so I'm writing this to remind myself. Breaks are helpful for two reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>They help you build back energy when you're tired</li>
        <li>They help you reflect about your work and make smart decisions</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The second reason may be even more helpful than the first. A thoughtful break can save you from spending time on things that you don't want/need to do. Often, the best thing to do is be lazy and think about what you can not do, instead of rushing to do everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        The evidence for this claim comes from a single anecdote: Today I was writing a simulator program (for a class) and trying to think of ways to make it faster. I had set my mind on one or two ideas and I was just about to start programming, when I felt that I should really take a break. I had been programming uninterrupted for a few hours and evening was falling. So I went for a walk and kept thinking about the program. I concluded that neither of my ideas would really improve performance dramatically, and would make the program considerably uglier, so I decided to do none of them. I saved myself a few hours and got some quality time outside by taking a break.
